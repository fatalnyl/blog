As a novice/beginner in using Linux, heck even a DIY distribution like [https://archlinux.org/](https://archlinux.org/ "Arch"). I think it's a very painful experience to even get sound in Arch. I figure if I write this down in a blog post so that others and myself can follow along make their own sound work.
