Customizing this site is kinda hard. 

The original theme is kind of minimalist which is good if I want to add features but at the same time I want other features from other themes too. I've been referencing other themes to modify this theme.

Hugo is a pain in the butt. I've been trying to learn Go but it's going to be taking a while...

In the mean time to test image uploading, here's a cat.
