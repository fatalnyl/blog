If computers are dumb then I am too. However it doesn't stop an idiot like me since I am too dumb to stop ğŸ—¿.

I study Electrical Engineering âš¡ğŸ’¥ğŸ’». 

My field of interests are wide but I enjoy learning about web development, algorithms, system programming, GNU/Linux and microelectronics and more ğŸ’¾.
